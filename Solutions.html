      <h1>Current and Future Solutions of Microplastic Pollution</h1>

      <h3>The Current State</h3>
      <p>
        Mismanaged waste generation tends to be very low at low income and higher income nations but very high at middle income nations. This waste is most at risk of entering the ocean in coastal populations. These ocean plastics are strongly influenced by the ocean's currents and wind patterns and therefore, accumulate at the highest concentrations of plastics at the center of ocean basins.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="Such as phthalates" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> Organic chemical pollutants</span> can cling or leech onto microplastics making them more toxic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although ingestion of microplastics can lead to deaths, the impact of microplastics on human health is difficult to judge currently. Most microplastics in food, such as fish, stay in t he guts and not the muscle, which is eaten by humans. Even so, plastic consumption at any level can be dangerous. Plastic has many different additives, including pigments, ultraviolet stabilizers, water repellents, flame retardants, stiffeners such as bisphenol A, and softeners such as phthalate. Flame retardants interfere with brain development in fetuses and children, and some compounds that stick on to plastics can cause cancer or birth defects.
      </p>

      <h3>The Current Solutions to Microplastic Pollution</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Plastic Recycling</span>: Many have tried to promote recycling. Pharrell Williams’ clothing brand launched a line called ‘RAW for the Ocean’, that recycles single use plastic containers and turns them into modern stylish clothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Beach Cleanups</span>: These cleanups help with the pollution of plastics on land. Many world-wide initiatives such as #Take3 for the Sea and #2 Minute Beach Clean up help encourage people to pick up plastic litter at the beaches that they are at.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Ocean Cleanups</span>: These cleanups do not solve the problem of microplastic pollution, although they are able to, in theory, get rid of larger plastics. Innovations for cleanups include deploying large floating booms to catch the plastic and floating sea bins that could be used to remove plastic from harbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Bioplastics</span>: Bioplastics are natural plastics made from plants, waste, or other renewable resources. 
      </p>
  
      <h3>Possible Future Solutions</h3>

      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Jellyfish Mucus</span>: In 2015, French researchers discovered that the mucus of jellyfish is capable of capturing gold nanoparticles contaminants in water. <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="an organization sponsored by the EU" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> GoJelly</span> is trying to figure out how this mucus could be stored and testing ways to integrate the mucus into water filters themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">MacRebur the Plastic Road Company</span>: This company turns one time use plastic destined for landfills or incineration into a <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="1 ton of this mix contains 80,000 water bottles worth of plastic" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> MacRebur mix</span> instead of cement for roads.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)</span>: This biodegradable 'plastic' that is made entirely out of microorganisms that feed on seaweed, produce absolutely no waste. This plastic will allow <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="such as Israel, China, and India" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> countries</span> with a shortage of fresh water to comfortably switch over to biodegradable plastics.
