        <p>
      	  Before the invention of plastic, only clay and glass could be molded. These materials were used for a variety of objects, such as storage, but glass and clay items were heavy and brittle. Some <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="such as tree gum and rubber" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> natural substances </span> were moldable, but they could not be used for storage as they eventually lost their ability to bounce back into shape and became sticky when heated.
        </p>
      
	      <p>
          At first, people used natural materials with intrinsic properties to try to create a material that was both easily molded and durable, which led to the discovery of shellac and chewing gum. Then scientists began to chemically modify natural materials, which led to the synthesis of rubber, nitrocellulose, collagen, and galalite.

	      <p>
          In 1839, Charles Goodyear accidentally discovered that crude rubber, when reacted with sulfur, became resilient after heating and cooling. The sulfur had bonded with the rubber polymer strands. These bonds cross linked with the polymer strands, letting them snapback, becoming highly moldable. This particular bonding process was named vulcanization.

          Similarly, in 1846, Charles Schonbein accidentally discovered that a mixture of nitric-acid sulfuric acid mixture reacts with cotton. The <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="nitrocellulose" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> resultant polymer </span>could burst into smokeless flames. This was used by the military instead of gunpowder.

          John Wesley Hyatt discovered a plastic that could be crafted into a variety of shapes in 1869, inspired by a New York firm’s offer of $10,000 for anyone who could provide a substitute for ivory. The plastic could be made to imitate <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="such as tortoiseshell, horn, linen, and ivory" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> natural substances </span>.
        </p> 
    	  <p>
          John Hyatt (1870) reacted nitrocellulose with camphor and made <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="plastic polymer used in film, pool balls, ping-pong balls, and dental plates" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> celluloid.</span>

          Leo Baekeland synthesized <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="first entirely synthetic polymer" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> Bakelite </span> (1907/1909), made from a condensation reaction between phenol and formaldehyde, where the phenol rings were bound into rigid three-dimensional polymers. Bakelite can be molded when hot and solidified into hard plastic that can be used for handles, phones, auto parts, furniture and even jewelry. It is also resilient to heat and electricity, and can’t be easily melted or scorched once cooled.

          Wallace Carothers invented nylon in 1930 from the condensation of adipic acid and a certain type of diaminohexane monomer that could be drawn out into a <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="such as silk" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> strong fiber </span> . Nylon was useful for its lightweight, strong, and durable qualities that made it the basis for many types of clothing, coverings (such as tents), luggage, bags, and ropes.

          Abrasion and fragmentation of larger plastic items and materials lead to the creation of <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="synthetic organic polymer particles with a size of less than 5 mm" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> microplastics</span>. They can come from a variety of sources such as city sewage, beach litter, storm runoff of plastic dust from street and roads, car tires, accidental spills form industry, ocean-dumping form shpis, laundry items, and the agricultural industry.
