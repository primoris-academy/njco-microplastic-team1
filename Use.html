            <span class="font-weight-bold">Thermosets</span>: They cannot change shape once they are molded. Examples include epoxides, polyurethan, <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold" title="Also known as Teflon" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> polytetrafluoroethylene</span>, and unsaturated polyester resins.
          </p>
  		    <p>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Thermoplastics</span>: They are able to soften and even melt when exposed to high temperatures. They can harden again once they are given time to cool. Examples include polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and polystyrene.
