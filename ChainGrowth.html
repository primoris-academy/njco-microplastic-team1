	    <h2><span title="Addition" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> Chain-Growth </span> Polymerization</h2>
		  <p>Chain-growth polymers are created by chain-reaction polymerization in which a reactive intermediate is formed, via an initiator that adds to the carbon-carbon double bond of an unsaturated substrate. This intermediate then reacts with another monomer, and another, and so on, to form a chain. The reaction occurs in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.</p>

		<h3><span title="Cationic" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> Acid-Catalyzed </span> Polymerization</h3>
		<p>The initiator is an acid. <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Initiation</span>: A proton from an acid is added to an alkene in order to form a carbocation <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Elongation</span>: Another alkene molecule donates an electron group, forming a larger carbocation, and this process continues, resulting in a higher molecular weight carbocation <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Termination</span>: Occurs with the loss of a proton <br>
Polymerization of isobutylene is given below: 
</p>  
		<div class="container">
		<h3>Anionic Polymerization</h3>
		<p>The initiator is an anion. <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Initiation</span>: Begins with an attack by a nucleophilic reagent on one end of a double bond, resulting in the formation of a carbanion  <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Elongation</span>: Attack by this carbanion on another alkene, results in a larger carbon carbanion, and this process continues, resulting in a higher molecular weight carbanion <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Termination</span>: The reaction is finished when the addition of any group, such as a proton, is carried out to destroy the carbanion on the other end of the chain <br>
Polymerization of styrene is given below:

	  <div class="container">
	  <h3>Free Radical Polymerization</h3>
	  <p>The initiator is a peroxide catalyst. <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Initiation</span>: Requires the formation of two free radicals, which is an uncharged molecule, usually with an unpaired valence electron <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Elongation</span>: The process continues with the stepwise addition of a free radical to an alkene molecule <br><span class="font-weight-bold">Termination</span>: The reaction ends with either the combination or the disproportionation of the free radicals <br>

	  	<h3>Coordination Polymerization</h3>
	  	<p>The polymerizations of ethene and propene using either of these processes result in high molecular weight polymers with astounding physical properties. </p>
<p><span class="font-weight-bold">Phillips Petroleum Process</span> <ul><li>Polymerization at low atmospheric pressure and temperature <li>Polymerization is achieved with the use of a aluminum-molybdenum oxide catalyst, which needs activation by hydrogen </ul>
<span class="font-weight-bold">Ziegler Process</span> <ul><li>Polymerization at atmospheric pressure and room temperature 
<li>Reaction occurs in an alkane solvent that exists in a suspension with the insoluble product from the reaction of triethyl-aluminum and titanium tetrachloride (which is also known as the Ziegler-Natta catalyst) 
<li>Copolymers of ethene and propene made using this process are highly elastic and called elastomers 
<li>Polymerization of propene using this process can be used to create durable fibers and molded into various shapes
